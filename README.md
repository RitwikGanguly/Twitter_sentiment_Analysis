## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining and extracting the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text data. It aims to understand the subjective information conveyed by the text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

#### The sentiment analysis of text data is performed using various techniques, including:
1) **Rule-based approach:** In this approach, a set of predefined rules or patterns is used to classify the sentiment of the text. These rules can be based on the presence of specific words, phrases, or linguistic patterns associated with positive or negative sentiment. Rule-based approaches often involve the use of sentiment lexicons or dictionaries that map words to sentiment scores.

2) **Machine learning approach:** This approach involves training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset of text samples, where each sample is annotated with its corresponding sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The model learns patterns and relationships between textual features (such as words, n-grams, or syntactic structures) and their associated sentiments. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text data.

3) **Hybrid approach:** Some sentiment analysis techniques combine rule-based and machine learning methods to benefit from the strengths of both. They may use rule-based methods for initial sentiment classification and then employ machine learning techniques to refine the results or handle more complex cases.

#### The process of performing sentiment analysis on text data typically involves the following steps:
1) **Text preprocessing:** This step involves cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis. It may include tasks such as removing special characters, punctuation, and irrelevant information, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text into individual words or sentences.

2) **Feature extraction:** In this step, relevant features are extracted from the text data. Features can include words, n-grams (sequences of multiple words), parts of speech, or other linguistic or contextual information that may be indicative of sentiment.

3) **Sentiment classification:** This is the core step where sentiment analysis techniques are applied to classify the sentiment of the text. Depending on the chosen approach (rule-based or machine learning), the sentiment of the text is determined based on predefined rules, sentiment lexicons, or by using a trained model.

4) **Result interpretation:** Once the sentiment classification is performed, the results are interpreted and analyzed. This can involve aggregating sentiment scores over multiple text samples, calculating sentiment proportions, or generating visualizations to understand the sentiment distribution.

> - **The Sentiment Analysis is a UnSupervised Technique**
> - **So can either use any one of the clustering technique(i.e. KMeans or DBSCAN) or else we have to use any ML lexical analysis technique.**
> - **If we will choose the sentiment analysis of any social media platform (i.e Twitter, Instragram etc) then the lexical analysis technique is easy to impliment and understand**
